# Reference Implementation (JavaScript/TypeScript)

This directory contains the original JavaScript/TypeScript implementation that serves as a reference for the Python implementation.

## Original Structure

The original implementation was a basic LLM debug proxy with the following features:
- Express.js server for proxying LLM requests
- Request/response logging and formatting
- Basic CLI options for output formatting
- Support for streaming and non-streaming responses

## Files

- `src/` - Original TypeScript source code
- `test/` - Original test files
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- Configuration files (eslint, jest, prettier, etc.)

## Usage as Reference

This code provides a good reference for:
- Understanding the basic proxy functionality
- Request/response handling patterns
- Streaming response processing
- CLI argument parsing
- Basic formatting utilities

The Python implementation will provide the same core functionality but with enhanced intelligence, security, and monitoring capabilities.
